# Socorro model

The AMI used for spinning up new instances is built using Packer (also in this
repo).  This AMI comes pre-installed with all of the bits and pieces required
to run pretty much every aspect of Socorro; however, by default, all of the
possible services are disabled.  There are a number of *roles* which determine
which aspects of the default AMI are configured and activated.

## Details

These variables have no useful default and must be supplied:
* `access_key`: The AWS access key.
* `secret_key`: The AWS secret key.
* `environment`: A prefix used to designate a logical deployment group.
* `secret_bucket`: The name of the bucket in which *secrets* are stored; more
   on this below.
* `subnets`: The name of one or more VPC subnets (comma-delimited) that you wish to launch infra in.
* `*_cert`: ARN ID's of various SSL certificates for web-facing services.
* `rds_root_password`: the password for the PostgreSQL RDS "root" user

You're welcome to deal with this in any number of ways. I suggest putting the
keys and bucket name in `terraform.tfvars` and specifying the environment at
runtime.

## Secret bucket

The `secret_bucket` is more or less exactly what it sounds like: an S3 bucket
that has strict access controls and is considered a safe place to store
sensitive data.  The wrapper expects this bucket to have a read-writeable
`tfstate/` directory at the root level.

The secret bucket also contains hiera keys, in the `hiera/` directory at the
root level. You must specify the hostname of the ELB to the consul
cluster inside a file named `hiera/${environment}/consul_hostname` and the
hostname to a syslog server inside a file named
`hiera/${environment}/logging_hostname`.

Puppet will use this to ensure that all nodes automatically join the Consul
and logging services, respectively.

## Runtime

The `wrapper.sh` script should be used instead of calling `terraform` directly. (Note: Not currently used at Mozilla)
This script effectively does two important things:
* Manages the idea of roles for you.
* Ensures that you're using the freshest `.tfstate` for a given role.

```bash
./wrapper.sh apply staging elasticsearch
```

That would:
* Obtain the latest `.tfstate` for the `elasticsearch` role (from the secret
  bucket as described above).
* Run `terraform apply -var "environment=staging"` for that role.
* Upload the resulting `.tfstate` to the secret bucket.

## Making changes live in staging and production

Anything landed on master will go to staging and be considered eligible for
pushing to production. Tags will be pushed to production.
